# Graph Neural Networks

Welcome to the **Graph Neural Networks** repository! This repository is a work-in-progress collection of resources designed to help anyone interested in learning about Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). It serves as a central hub for educational materials, research papers, and code implementations that I have encountered and found useful along my learning journey.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository will be organized into the following sections:

1. **Papers**: 
   - A collection of foundational and advanced research papers on Graph Neural Networks.
   - Topics to include:
     - GCNs (Graph Convolutional Networks)
     - GATs (Graph Attention Networks)
     - GraphSAGE, and more.

2. **Lecture Slides**: 
   - Educational slides from courses, workshops, and tutorials that explain the core concepts and applications of GNNs.

3. **Textbook Chapters**:
   - Relevant chapters from textbooks on GNNs, graph theory, and deep learning that provide theoretical foundations.

4. **Code Implementations**:
   - Practical code snippets and projects based on GNN models and applications.
   - I’ll upload:
     - My implementations of GNN algorithms.

## 🛠 Contribution Guidelines

This repository is still in its early stages, and I plan to grow it over time. If you have suggestions for resources or want to contribute, feel free to:
- Open an issue for discussion.
- Share links to useful materials I might have missed.

For now, I will primarily focus on uploading and organizing my own resources.
